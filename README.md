# Seminar : More Form processing Practice

1. Put the files on a server. Check you can view them.
2. Make some changes to form.html so that when the user clicks the submit button process.php gets loaded. 
3. In process.php add some code that will display the text the user has entered into the form.
4. Modify this so that the user gets a nice message e.g. *Welcome Alice*
5. Modify the code so that it tests if the form has been submitted. If the user navigates directly to process.php without first visiting form.html display an error message. Look on the form processing notes from week 1 for advice.
6. Modify this so that it also tests if the user has entered a value into the textbox.  If the user hasn't entered a name, an error message should be displayed.
